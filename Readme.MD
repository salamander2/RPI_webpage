This project is to look at how Raspberry Pis can read information from the internet (a webpage) as well as transmit info to the internet (a webpage).

The intent is to use the internet to control the RPI, but also for the RPI to send data to the webpage.  This is really just a proof of concept now.
If the Raspberry Pi were connected to sensors or a robot and a camera, then it would be useful to be able to control things remotely, or sense the temperature at home ...

There is no security to this yet. The webpage would need a password (the simplest is by using .htaccess).
